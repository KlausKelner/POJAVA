OK heres our project. 

What do we have :
- Basic knowledge about git / how it works / how to push ect.

What has been done :
- We have made our project live :
      - It calculates data using formulas added in introduction.
      - It gives us raw data in notebook which we would like to 
      use in our interface.
      
What we are now working on :
- Interface 
- Math to describe the transistor voltage / current plot.

Do we have questions - sure we do :)

Ok thats it for now.
